Navigation bar added
Foundation for creating tabs (fragments) added
Logic to hide keyboard added (currently commented out as it's a bit buggy, works sometimes, other times crashes)
MyUtilities class added for helper functions

Notes:
I've commented out almost all of the code added to calculate winrate from the edittext fields as i've changed the foundation layout. Instead of residing in the main activity, the text boxes have been moved to the input form fragment. The code will most likely need to be moved to the InputFormFragment class.
I could not get the log-in feature of firebase working so I changed the default activity back to MainActivity which hosts the navigationview layout and defaults to the Input Form fragment.

Things to work on:
Debug keyboard functionality
Add functionality to switch between fragments from the navigation bar
