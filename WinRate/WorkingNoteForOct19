Implemented the store of user input and construct a database.

Problem in prograss:

For counting the total win and lose, 
1)get current win and lose num from database,
2)convert it to int type and add with the global variable, winCounter(winC) and loseCounter(loseC)
3)push the final value to the database with setValue().

However, this design isn't work correctly. The numb of total win and lose both remain 0 after I submit 
one log the database. Still working on it.

Database structure(theorical):

UserUid(unique and unchangeable)
	-total win num
	-total lose num
	-data0 
		-Date
		-Opponent Deck
		-Player Deck
		-Opponent name
		-win or lose
